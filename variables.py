#what is variable and why do we use variables
# variabel is like a container that store a value which is asssinged to it
# lets say we asked the user a input
input("give me a number from 1 to 10: ")
#here teh user has given a number from 1 to 10 but it is not printed3
#now you have to show the user what number he has entered
print(input("give me a number from 1 to 10: "))
#now each time a number is asked to user and want to print that number
#we have the this big line of code 
#but now lets assign the input given by the user to a variable
number = input("give me a number from 1 to 10: ")
#now when ever you want to print a number from 1 to 10 given by the user
#just print the variable
print(number)
